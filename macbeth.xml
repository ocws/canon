        <note>Macbeth tells the story of a Scottish general named Macbeth who receives a prophecy from a three of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the throne for himself. He soon becomes a tyrannical ruler as he is forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from suspicion. The events which follow take Macbeth and Lady Macbeth deeper and deeper into madness. </note>

                    Worthy to be a rebel, for to that

                    And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
                    Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
                    For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
                    Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
                    Which smoked with bloody execution,
                    Like valour's minion carved out his passage
                    Till he faced the slave;
                    Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
                    Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,

                    Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
                    No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
                    Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
                    But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
                    With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
                    Began a fresh assault.</text>

                    Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
                    The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
                    Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
                    Confronted him with self-comparisons,
                    Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
                    Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,

                    learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
                    them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
                    to question them further, they made themselves air,
                    into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
                    the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
                    all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,
                    before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
                    me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
                    shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
                    thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
                    mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being

                    Art not without ambition, but without
                    The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
                    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
                    And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
                    That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
                    And that which rather thou dost fear to do
                    Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,

                    So clear in his great office, that his virtues
                    Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
                    The deep damnation of his taking-off;
                    And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
                    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
                    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
                    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
                    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
                    To prick the sides of my intent, but only
                    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
                    And falls on the other.</text>

                <text char="Macbeth" type="verse">Hath he ask'd for me?</text>
                <text char="Lady Macbeth" type="verse">Know you not he has?</text>
                <text char="Macbeth" type="verse">We will proceed no further in this business:
                    He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
                    Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
                    Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
                    Not cast aside so soon.</text>
                <text char="Lady Macbeth" type="verse">Was the hope drunk
                    Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
                    And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
                    At what it did so freely? From this time
                    Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
                    To be the same in thine own act and valour
                    As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
                    Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
                    And live a coward in thine own esteem,
                    Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
                    Like the poor cat i' the adage?</text>
                <text char="Macbeth" type="verse">Prithee, peace:
                    I dare do all that may become a man;
                    Who dares do more is none.</text>
                <text char="Lady Macbeth" type="verse">What beast was't, then,
                    That made you break this enterprise to me?
                    When you durst do it, then you were a man;
                    And, to be more than what you were, you would
                    Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
                    Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
                    They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
                    Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
                    How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
                    I would, while it was smiling in my face,
                    Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
                    And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
                    Have done to this.</text>

                    But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
                    And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--

                    Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
                    Will I with wine and wassail so convince
                    That memory, the warder of the brain,
                    Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
                    A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
                    Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
                    What cannot you and I perform upon
                    The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
                    His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
                    Of our great quell?</text>
                <text char="Macbeth" type="verse">Bring forth men-children only;
                    For thy undaunted mettle should compose

                    When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
                    Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
                    That they have done't?</text>

                <text char="Macbeth" type="verse">I am settled, and bend up
                    Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
                    Away, and mock the time with fairest show:

                    The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
                    I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
                    Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
                    To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
                    A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
                    Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
                    I see thee yet, in form as palpable
                    As this which now I draw.
                    Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
                    And such an instrument I was to use.
                    Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
                    Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
                    And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
                    Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
                    It is the bloody business which informs
                    Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
                    Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
                    The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
                    Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
                    Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
                    Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
                    With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
                    Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
                    Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
                    Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
                    And take the present horror from the time,
                    Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:

                    They must lie there: go carry them; and smear

                <text char="Lady Macbeth" type="verse">Infirm of purpose!
                    Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
                    Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
                    That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,

                    Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
                    Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
                    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
                    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
                    To act in safety. There is none but he
                    Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
                    My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
                    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
                    When first they put the name of king upon me,
                    And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
                    They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
                    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
                    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
                    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
                    No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
                    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
                    For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
                    Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
                    Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
                    Given to the common enemy of man,
                    To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
                    Rather than so, come fate into the list.

                    All by the name of dogs: the valued file
                    Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,

                    Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
                    While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
                    Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
                    Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
                    So, prithee, go with me.</text>

                    If charnel-houses and our graves must send

                    Great business must be wrought ere noon:
                    Upon the corner of the moon
                    There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
                    I'll catch it ere it come to ground:
                    And that distill'd by magic sleights
                    Shall raise such artificial sprites
                    As by the strength of their illusion
                    Shall draw him on to his confusion:
                    He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
                    He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:
                    And you all know, security
                    Is mortals' chiefest enemy.</text>

                <text char="Lennox" type="verse">My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
                    Which can interpret further: only, I say,
                    Things have been strangely borne. The
                    gracious Duncan
                    Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
                    And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
                    Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
                    For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
                    Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
                    It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
                    To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
                    How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
                    In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
                    That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
                    Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
                    For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
                    To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
                    He has borne all things well: and I do think
                    That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
                    As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they
                    should find
                    What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
                    But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd
                    His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
                    Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell
                    Where he bestows himself?</text>
                <text char="Lord" type="verse">The son of Duncan,
                    From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
                    Lives in the English court, and is received
                    Of the most pious Edward with such grace
                    That the malevolence of fortune nothing
                    Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
                    Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
                    To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:
                    That, by the help of these--with Him above
                    To ratify the work--we may again
                    Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
                    Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
                    Do faithful homage and receive free honours:
                    All which we pine for now: and this report
                    Hath so exasperate the king that he
                    Prepares for some attempt of war.</text>

                    Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
                    His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
                    Fly to the court of England and unfold
                    His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
                    May soon return to this our suffering country

                    The very firstlings of my heart shall be
                    The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
                    To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
                    The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
                    Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
                    His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
                    That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
                    This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
                    But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?

                    His mansion and his titles in a place

                    He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,
                    The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
                    Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
                    All is the fear and nothing is the love;

                    And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
                    From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
                    But float upon a wild and violent sea
                    Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
                    Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
                    Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward

                    New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
                    Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds

                    What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
                    This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
                    Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
                    He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;

                    That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
                    Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
                    Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,

                    Without leave-taking? I pray you,
                    Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,

                    I would not be the villain that thou think'st

                    I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
                    It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
                    Is added to her wounds: I think withal
                    There would be hands uplifted in my right;
                    And here from gracious England have I offer
                    Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
                    When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
                    Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
                    Shall have more vices than it had before,
                    More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,

                    That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
                    Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
                    Esteem him as a lamb, being compared

                <text char="Malcolm" type="verse">I grant him bloody,
                    Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,

                    That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
                    In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
                    Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
                    The cistern of my lust, and my desire
                    All continent impediments would o'erbear
                    That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
                    Than such an one to reign.</text>
                <text char="Macduff" type="verse">Boundless intemperance
                    In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
                    The untimely emptying of the happy throne
                    And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
                    To take upon you what is yours: you may
                    Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
                    And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
                    We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
                    That vulture in you, to devour so many
                    As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
                    Finding it so inclined.</text>
                <text char="Malcolm" type="verse">With this there grows
                    In my most ill-composed affection such
                    A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
                    I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
                    Desire his jewels and this other's house:
                    And my more-having would be as a sauce
                    To make me hunger more; that I should forge
                    Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
                    Destroying them for wealth.</text>
                <text char="Macduff" type="verse">This avarice
                    Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
                    Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
                    The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
                    Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
                    Of your mere own: all these are portable,
                    With other graces weigh'd.</text>
                <text char="Malcolm" type="verse">But I have none: the king-becoming graces,

                    Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
                    I have no relish of them, but abound
                    In the division of each several crime,
                    Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
                    Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
                    Uproar the universal peace, confound

                    Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
                    These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
                    Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
                    Thy hope ends here!</text>
                <text char="Malcolm" type="verse">Macduff, this noble passion,
                    Child of integrity, hath from my soul
                    Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
                    To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
                    By many of these trains hath sought to win me
                    Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
                    From over-credulous haste: but God above
                    Deal between thee and me! for even now
                    I put myself to thy direction, and
                    Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
                    The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
                    For strangers to my nature. I am yet
                    Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
                    Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
                    At no time broke my faith, would not betray
                    The devil to his fellow and delight
                    No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
                    Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
                    Is thine and my poor country's to command:
                    Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
                    Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
                    Already at a point, was setting forth.
                    Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness
                    Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?</text>

                    A most miraculous work in this good king;
                    Which often, since my here-remain in England,
                    I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
                    Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,
                    All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
                    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
                    Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
                    Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,
                    To the succeeding royalty he leaves
                    The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
                    He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
                    And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
                    That speak him full of grace.</text>

                    Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
                    Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
                    But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
                    Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
                    Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
                    A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
                    Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
                    Expire before the flowers in their caps,

                <text char="Ross" type="verse">When I came hither to transport the tidings,
                    Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
                    Of many worthy fellows that were out;
                    Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
                    For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
                    Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
                    Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
                    To doff their dire distresses.</text>
                <text char="Malcolm" type="verse">Be't their comfort
                    We are coming thither: gracious England hath

                    An older and a better soldier none

                <text char="Ross" type="verse">Would I could answer

                    Where hearing should not latch them.</text>
                <text char="Macduff" type="verse">What concern they?
                    The general cause? or is it a fee-grief

                <text char="Ross" type="verse">No mind that's honest

                <text char="Macduff" type="verse">If it be mine,

                    What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;
                    Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
                    Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.</text>

                    Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
                    What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
                    At one fell swoop?</text>
                <text char="Malcolm" type="verse">Dispute it like a man.</text>
                <text char="Macduff" type="verse">I shall do so;
                    But I must also feel it as a man:
                    I cannot but remember such things were,
                    That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
                    And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
                    They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
                    Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
                    Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!</text>
                <text char="Malcolm" type="verse">Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
                    Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.</text>
                <text char="Macduff" type="verse">O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
                    And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
                    Cut short all intermission; front to front
                    Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
                    Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
                    Heaven forgive him too!</text>

                    Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
                    I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
                    By this great clatter, one of greatest note
                    Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
                    And more I beg not.</text>
