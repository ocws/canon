                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
                    Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
                    Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
                    Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
                    Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
                    Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</text>
                <text char="JOHN OF GAUNT" type="verse">I have, my liege.</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
                    If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;
                    Or worthily, as a good subject should,
                    On some known ground of treachery in him?</text>
                <text char="JOHN OF GAUNT" type="verse">As near as I could sift him on that argument,
                    On some apparent danger seen in him
                    Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">Then call them to our presence; face to face,
                    And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
                    The accuser and the accused freely speak:
                    High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
                    In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</text>

                <text char="HENRY BOLINGBROKE" type="verse">Many years of happy days befal
                    My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!</text>
                <text char="THOMAS MOWBRAY" type="verse">Each day still better other's happiness;
                    Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
                    Add an immortal title to your crown!</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
                    As well appeareth by the cause you come;
                    Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
                    Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
                    Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</text>
                <text char="HENRY BOLINGBROKE" type="verse">First, heaven be the record to my speech!
                    In the devotion of a subject's love,
                    Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
                    And free from other misbegotten hate,
                    Come I appellant to this princely presence.
                    Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
                    And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
                    My body shall make good upon this earth,
                    Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
                    Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
                    Too good to be so and too bad to live,
                    Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
                    The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
                    Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
                    With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
                    And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
                    What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.</text>
                <text char="THOMAS MOWBRAY" type="verse">Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
                    'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
                    The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
                    Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
                    The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
                    Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
                    As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
                    First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
                    From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
                    Which else would post until it had return'd
                    These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
                    Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
                    And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
                    I do defy him, and I spit at him;
                    Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
                    Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
                    And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
                    Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
                    Or any other ground inhabitable,
                    Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
                    Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
                    By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</text>
                <text char="HENRY BOLINGBROKE" type="verse">Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
                    Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
                    And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
                    Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
                    If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
                    As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
                    By that and all the rites of knighthood else,
                    Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
                    What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.</text>
                <text char="THOMAS MOWBRAY" type="verse">I take it up; and by that sword I swear
                    Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
                    I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
                    Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
                    And when I mount, alive may I not light,
                    If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
                    It must be great that can inherit us
                    So much as of a thought of ill in him.</text>
                <text char="HENRY BOLINGBROKE" type="verse">Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
                    That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
                    In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
                    The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
                    Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
                    Besides I say and will in battle prove,
                    Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
                    That ever was survey'd by English eye,
                    That all the treasons for these eighteen years
                    Complotted and contrived in this land
                    Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
                    Further I say and further will maintain
                    Upon his bad life to make all this good,
                    That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
                    Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
                    And consequently, like a traitor coward,
                    Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
                    Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
                    Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
                    To me for justice and rough chastisement;
                    And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
                    This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">How high a pitch his resolution soars!
                    Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?</text>
                <text char="THOMAS MOWBRAY" type="verse">O, let my sovereign turn away his face
                    And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
                    Till I have told this slander of his blood,
                    How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
                    Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
                    As he is but my father's brother's son,
                    Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
                    Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
                    Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
                    The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
                    He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
                    Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</text>
                <text char="THOMAS MOWBRAY" type="verse">Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
                    Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
                    Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
                    Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
                    The other part reserved I by consent,
                    For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
                    Upon remainder of a dear account,
                    Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
                    Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
                    I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
                    Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
                    For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
                    The honourable father to my foe
                    Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
                    A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
                    But ere I last received the sacrament
                    I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
                    Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
                    This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,
                    It issues from the rancour of a villain,
                    A recreant and most degenerate traitor
                    Which in myself I boldly will defend;
                    And interchangeably hurl down my gage
                    Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
                    To prove myself a loyal gentleman
                    Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
                    In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
                    Your highness to assign our trial day.</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;
                    Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
                    This we prescribe, though no physician;
                    Deep malice makes too deep incision;
                    Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;
                    Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
                    Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
                    We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</text>
                <text char="JOHN OF GAUNT" type="verse">To be a make-peace shall become my age:
                    Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">And, Norfolk, throw down his.</text>
                <text char="JOHN OF GAUNT" type="verse">When, Harry, when?
                    Obedience bids I should not bid again.</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.</text>
                <text char="THOMAS MOWBRAY" type="verse">Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
                    My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
                    The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
                    Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
                    To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
                    I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
                    Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
                    The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
                    Which breathed this poison.</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">Rage must be withstood:
                    Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.</text>
                <text char="THOMAS MOWBRAY" type="verse">Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.
                    And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
                    The purest treasure mortal times afford
                    Is spotless reputation: that away,
                    Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
                    A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
                    Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
                    Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
                    Take honour from me, and my life is done:
                    Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
                    In that I live and for that will I die.</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.</text>
                <text char="HENRY BOLINGBROKE" type="verse">O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
                    Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?
                    Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
                    Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
                    Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
                    Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
                    The slavish motive of recanting fear,
                    And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
                    Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.</text>

                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">We were not born to sue, but to command;

                    Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
                    At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
                    There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
                    The swelling difference of your settled hate:
                    Since we can not atone you, we shall see

                    Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
                    To stir against the butchers of his life!
                    But since correction lieth in those hands
                    Which made the fault that we cannot correct,

                    Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,

                <text char="DUCHESS" type="verse">Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
                    Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
                    Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
                    Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
                    Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
                    Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
                    Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
                    But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
                    One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
                    One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
                    Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
                    Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,
                    By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
                    Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
                    That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
                    Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
                    Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
                    In some large measure to thy father's death,
                    In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
                    Who was the model of thy father's life.
                    Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
                    In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
                    Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
                    Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
                    That which in mean men we intitle patience
                    Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
                    What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
                    The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.</text>

                    Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
                    Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
                    O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
                    That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
                    Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
                    Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
                    They may break his foaming courser's back,
                    And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
                    A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
                    Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
                    With her companion grief must end her life.</text>
                <text char="JOHN OF GAUNT" type="verse">Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:
                    As much good stay with thee as go with me!</text>
                <text char="DUCHESS" type="verse">Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
                    Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
                    I take my leave before I have begun,
                    For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
                    Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
                    Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
                    Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
                    I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
                    With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
                    Alack, and what shall good old York there see
                    But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
                    Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
                    And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
                    Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
                    To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
                    Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:
                    The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.</text>

                    Since thou hast far to go, bear not along
                    The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.</text>

                    My name be blotted from the book of life,

                    But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;
                    And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.
                    Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;

                    But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
                    For, ere the six years that he hath to spend
                    Can change their moons and bring their times about
                    My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light

                    My inch of taper will be burnt and done,

                    Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,

                    Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
                    But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;
                    Thy word is current with him for my death,

                    Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:

                    You urged me as a judge; but I had rather
                    You would have bid me argue like a father.
                    O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
                    To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
                    A partial slander sought I to avoid,
                    And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.
                    Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,
                    I was too strict to make mine own away;
                    But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue

                    Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
                    To foreign passages, and in the end,
                    Having my freedom, boast of nothing else

                    Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
                    Teach thy necessity to reason thus;
                    There is no virtue like necessity.
                    Think not the king did banish thee,
                    But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,
                    Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
                    Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour
                    And not the king exiled thee; or suppose
                    Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
                    And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
                    Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
                    To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:
                    Suppose the singing birds musicians,
                    The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,
                    The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more
                    Than a delightful measure or a dance;
                    For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
                    The man that mocks at it and sets it light.</text>
                <text char="HENRY BOLINGBROKE" type="verse">O, who can hold a fire in his hand
                    By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
                    Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
                    By bare imagination of a feast?
                    Or wallow naked in December snow
                    By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
                    O, no! the apprehension of the good
                    Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
                    Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
                    Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.</text>

                    Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
                    Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance

                    And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
                    Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
                    To counterfeit oppression of such grief
                    That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
                    Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
                    And added years to his short banishment,
                    He should have had a volume of farewells;
                    But since it would not, he had none of me.</text>

                    Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
                    Observed his courtship to the common people;
                    How he did seem to dive into their hearts
                    With humble and familiar courtesy,
                    What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
                    Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
                    And patient underbearing of his fortune,
                    As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
                    Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
                    A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
                    And had the tribute of his supple knee,
                    With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
                    As were our England in reversion his,
                    And he our subjects' next degree in hope.</text>

                    Enforce attention like deep harmony:
                    Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,
                    For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
                    He that no more must say is listen'd more
                    Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
                    More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:

                    As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
                    Writ in remembrance more than things long past:
                    Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,
                    My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.</text>

                    The open ear of youth doth always listen;
                    Report of fashions in proud Italy,
                    Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
                    Limps after in base imitation.
                    Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
                    So it be new, there's no respect how vile--
                    That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
                    Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
                    Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
                    Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
                    'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.</text>

                    For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
                    Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
                    He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
                    With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
                    Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
                    Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
                    This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,

                    Dear for her reputation through the world,
                    Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,
                    Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
                    England, bound in with the triumphant sea
                    Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
                    Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
                    With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:
                    That England, that was wont to conquer others,
                    Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
                    Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
                    How happy then were my ensuing death!</text>

                    Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:
                    Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;
                    And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
                    For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;
                    Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
                    The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,

                    Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
                    Of those physicians that first wounded thee:

                    O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
                    Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,
                    From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,
                    Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,

                    Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
                    With fury from his native residence.
                    Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,

                    Which live like venom where no venom else
                    But only they have privilege to live.
                    And for these great affairs do ask some charge,
                    Towards our assistance we do seize to us
                    The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,
                    Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.</text>

                    Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,

                    Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
                    Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
                    I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
                    Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
                    In war was never lion raged more fierce,
                    In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
                    Than was that young and princely gentleman.
                    His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,
                    Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;
                    But when he frown'd, it was against the French
                    And not against his friends; his noble hand
                    Did will what he did spend and spent not that
                    Which his triumphant father's hand had won;
                    His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
                    But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
                    O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
                    Or else he never would compare between.</text>

                    Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
                    The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?
                    Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
                    Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
                    Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
                    Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
                    Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time
                    His charters and his customary rights;
                    Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;

                    Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
                    If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,

                    By his attorneys-general to sue
                    His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,
                    You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,
                    You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
                    And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
                    Which honour and allegiance cannot think.</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">Think what you will, we seize into our hands

                    Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
                    Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
                    And make high majesty look like itself,
                    Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
                    But if you faint, as fearing to do so,

                <text char="BUSHY" type="verse">Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
                    You promised, when you parted with the king,
                    To lay aside life-harming heaviness
                    And entertain a cheerful disposition.</text>
                <text char="QUEEN" type="verse">To please the king I did; to please myself
                    I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
                    Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
                    Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
                    As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,
                    Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
                    Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
                    With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,
                    More than with parting from my lord the king.</text>
                <text char="BUSHY" type="verse">Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
                    Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
                    For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
                    Divides one thing entire to many objects;
                    Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
                    Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
                    Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
                    Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
                    Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;
                    Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
                    Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
                    More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
                    Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
                    Which for things true weeps things imaginary.</text>
                <text char="QUEEN" type="verse">It may be so; but yet my inward soul
                    Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,
                    I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad
                    As, though on thinking on no thought I think,
                    Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.</text>

                    For nothing had begot my something grief;
                    Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
                    'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
                    But what it is, that is not yet known; what

                    With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.</text>

                    These high wild hills and rough uneven ways

                <text char="HENRY BOLINGBROKE" type="verse">My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;
                    And I am come to seek that name in England;
                    And I must find that title in your tongue,
                    Before I make reply to aught you say.</text>

                    From the most gracious regent of this land,
                    The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
                    To take advantage of the absent time
                    And fright our native peace with self-born arms.</text>

                <text char="DUKE OF YORK" type="verse">Tut, tut!
                    Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
                    I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'
                    In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
                    Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
                    Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
                    But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
                    So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
                    Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
                    And ostentation of despised arms?
                    Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
                    Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
                    And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
                    Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
                    As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
                    Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
                    From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
                    O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.
                    Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee
                    And minister correction to thy fault!</text>
                <text char="HENRY BOLINGBROKE" type="verse">My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
                    On what condition stands it and wherein?</text>
                <text char="DUKE OF YORK" type="verse">Even in condition of the worst degree,
                    In gross rebellion and detested treason:
                    Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come
                    Before the expiration of thy time,
                    In braving arms against thy sovereign.</text>
                <text char="HENRY BOLINGBROKE" type="verse">As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
                    But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
                    And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace
                    Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
                    You are my father, for methinks in you
                    I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,
                    Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
                    A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
                    Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
                    To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
                    If that my cousin king be King of England,
                    It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
                    You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;
                    Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
                    He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
                    To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
                    I am denied to sue my livery here,
                    And yet my letters-patents give me leave:
                    My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
                    And these and all are all amiss employ'd.
                    What would you have me do? I am a subject,
                    And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;
                    And therefore, personally I lay my claim
                    To my inheritance of free descent.</text>
                <text char="NORTHUMBERLAND" type="verse">The noble duke hath been too much abused.</text>
                <text char="LORD ROSS" type="verse">It stands your grace upon to do him right.</text>

                    I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
                    And laboured all I could to do him right;
                    But in this kind to come, in braving arms,
                    Be his own carver and cut out his way,
                    To find out right with wrong, it may not be;
                    And you that do abet him in this kind
                    Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.</text>
                <text char="NORTHUMBERLAND" type="verse">The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
                    But for his own; and for the right of that
                    We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
                    And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!</text>
                <text char="DUKE OF YORK" type="verse">Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:
                    I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
                    Because my power is weak and all ill left:
                    But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
                    I would attach you all and make you stoop
                    Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
                    But since I cannot, be it known to you
                    I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;
                    Unless you please to enter in the castle
                    And there repose you for this night.</text>
                <text char="HENRY BOLINGBROKE" type="verse">An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
                    But we must win your grace to go with us
                    To Bristol castle, which they say is held
                    By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,
                    The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
                    Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.</text>
                <text char="DUKE OF YORK" type="verse">It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
                    For I am loath to break our country's laws.
                    Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:
                    Things past redress are now with me past care.</text>

                    Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
                    Since presently your souls must part your bodies--
                    With too much urging your pernicious lives,
                    For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
                    From off my hands, here in the view of men
                    I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
                    You have misled a prince, a royal king,
                    A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
                    By you unhappied and disfigured clean:
                    You have in manner with your sinful hours
                    Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
                    Broke the possession of a royal bed
                    And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
                    With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
                    Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
                    Near to the king in blood, and near in love
                    Till you did make him misinterpret me,
                    Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
                    And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,
                    Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
                    Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
                    Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
                    From my own windows torn my household coat,
                    Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
                    Save men's opinions and my living blood,
                    To show the world I am a gentleman.
                    This and much more, much more than twice all this,
                    Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over
                    To execution and the hand of death.</text>
                <text char="BUSHY" type="verse">More welcome is the stroke of death to me

                    To stand upon my kingdom once again.
                    Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
                    Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
                    As a long-parted mother with her child
                    Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
                    So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
                    And do thee favours with my royal hands.
                    Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
                    Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;
                    But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
                    And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
                    Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
                    Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
                    Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
                    And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
                    Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
                    Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
                    Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
                    Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
                    This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
                    Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king

                <text char="BISHOP OF CARLISLE" type="verse">Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king
                    Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
                    The means that heaven yields must be embraced,
                    And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
                    And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,

                    Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
                    Grows strong and great in substance and in power.</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
                    That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
                    Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
                    Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
                    In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
                    But when from under this terrestrial ball
                    He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
                    And darts his light through every guilty hole,
                    Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
                    The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
                    Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
                    So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
                    Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
                    Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,
                    Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
                    His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
                    Not able to endure the sight of day,
                    But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
                    Not all the water in the rough rude sea
                    Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
                    The breath of worldly men cannot depose
                    The deputy elected by the Lord:
                    For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
                    To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
                    God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
                    A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
                    Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.</text>

                    Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
                    And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
                    One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
                    Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:
                    O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
                    And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
                    To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,
                    O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:
                    For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.
                    Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.</text>
                <text char="DUKE OF AUMERLE" type="verse">Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">But now the blood of twenty thousand men
                    Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
                    And, till so much blood thither come again,
                    Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
                    All souls that will be safe fly from my side,
                    For time hath set a blot upon my pride.</text>

                    Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
                    Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
                    Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
                    At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
                    Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
                    High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
                    Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?</text>

                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
                    The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
                    Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
                    And what loss is it to be rid of care?
                    Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
                    Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
                    We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
                    Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
                    They break their faith to God as well as us:
                    Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:
                    The worst is death, and death will have his day.</text>

                    To bear the tidings of calamity.
                    Like an unseasonable stormy day,
                    Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
                    As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
                    So high above his limits swells the rage
                    Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
                    With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
                    White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
                    Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,
                    Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
                    In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
                    The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
                    Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
                    Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
                    Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
                    And all goes worse than I have power to tell.</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
                    Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
                    What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
                    That they have let the dangerous enemy
                    Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
                    If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:
                    I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.</text>

                    Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!

                    Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
                    Would they make peace? terrible hell make war

                    Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
                    With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse
                    Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
                    And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.</text>

                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
                    Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
                    Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
                    Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
                    Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
                    And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
                    Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
                    Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
                    And nothing can we call our own but death
                    And that small model of the barren earth
                    Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
                    For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
                    And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
                    How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
                    Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
                    Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
                    All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
                    That rounds the mortal temples of a king
                    Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
                    Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
                    Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
                    To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,
                    Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
                    As if this flesh which walls about our life,
                    Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus
                    Comes at the last and with a little pin
                    Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
                    Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
                    With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
                    Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,
                    For you have but mistook me all this while:
                    I live with bread like you, feel want,
                    Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
                    How can you say to me, I am a king?</text>
                <text char="BISHOP OF CARLISLE" type="verse">My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
                    But presently prevent the ways to wail.
                    To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
                    Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
                    And so your follies fight against yourself.
                    Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
                    And fight and die is death destroying death;
                    Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.</text>
                <text char="DUKE OF AUMERLE" type="verse">My father hath a power; inquire of him

                    To change blows with thee for our day of doom.
                    This ague fit of fear is over-blown;
                    An easy task it is to win our own.
                    Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
                    Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.</text>

                    So may you by my dull and heavy eye,
                    My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
                    I play the torturer, by small and small
                    To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
                    Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,
                    And all your northern castles yielded up,
                    And all your southern gentlemen in arms
                    Upon his party.</text>
                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">Thou hast said enough.
                    Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth</text>

                    What say you now? what comfort have we now?
                    By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
                    That bids me be of comfort any more.
                    Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
                    A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
                    That power I have, discharge; and let them go
                    To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
                    For I have none: let no man speak again
                    To alter this, for counsel is but vain.</text>

                    Within the limits of yon lime and stone:
                    And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
                    Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman

                    Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
                    Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
                    Henry Bolingbroke
                    On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
                    And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
                    To his most royal person, hither come
                    Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
                    Provided that my banishment repeal'd
                    And lands restored again be freely granted:
                    If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
                    And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
                    Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:
                    The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
                    It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
                    The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
                    My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
                    Go, signify as much, while here we march
                    Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
                    Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,
                    That from this castle's tatter'd battlements
                    Our fair appointments may be well perused.
                    Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
                    With no less terror than the elements
                    Of fire and water, when their thundering shock
                    At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
                    Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:
                    The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
                    My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
                    March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.</text>

                    If we be not, show us the hand of God
                    That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;
                    For well we know, no hand of blood and bone
                    Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,
                    Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
                    And though you think that all, as you have done,
                    Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
                    And we are barren and bereft of friends;
                    Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
                    Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
                    Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike

                    That lift your vassal hands against my head

                    Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--
                    That every stride he makes upon my land
                    Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
                    The purple testament of bleeding war;
                    But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
                    Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
                    Shall ill become the flower of England's face,
                    Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
                    To scarlet indignation and bedew
                    Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.</text>

                    Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;
                    And by the honourable tomb he swears,

                    Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
                    His coming hither hath no further scope
                    Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
                    Enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees:
                    Which on thy royal party granted once,

                    This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;

                    My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
                    My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
                    My subjects for a pair of carved saints
                    And my large kingdom for a little grave,
                    A little little grave, an obscure grave;
                    Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,
                    Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet

                    Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
                    And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
                    As thus, to drop them still upon one place,
                    Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
                    Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies
                    Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.
                    Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see

                    Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,

                    Cousin, I am too young to be your father,

                    King Richard, he is in the mighty hold

                    And some few vanities that make him light;

                    Besides himself, are all the English peers,
                    And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.

                    Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd

                    Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
                    In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
                    I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
                    That reacheth from the restful English court
                    As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'
                    Amongst much other talk, that very time,
                    I heard you say that you had rather refuse
                    The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
                    Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
                    Adding withal how blest this land would be

                    Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
                    With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
                    There is my gage, the manual seal of death,

                    And will maintain what thou hast said is false

                    I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it
                    That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
                    If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;

                    And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,
                    To tie thee to my strong correction.
                    As I intend to thrive in this new world,
                    Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
                    Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say
                    That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men

                    To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,
                    Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.</text>

                    Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought

                    Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
                    Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:
                    And toil'd with works of war, retired himself
                    To Italy; and there at Venice gave
                    His body to that pleasant country's earth,
                    And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,

                    Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
                    Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
                    Would God that any in this noble presence
                    Were enough noble to be upright judge
                    Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would

                    What subject can give sentence on his king?
                    And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
                    Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,
                    Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
                    And shall the figure of God's majesty,

                    Be judged by subject and inferior breath,

                    That in a Christian climate souls refined
                    Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
                    I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
                    Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
                    My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
                    Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:
                    And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
                    The blood of English shall manure the ground,
                    And future ages groan for this foul act;
                    Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
                    And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
                    Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
                    Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
                    Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd
                    The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
                    O, if you raise this house against this house,
                    It will the woefullest division prove
                    That ever fell upon this cursed earth.

                    Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd
                    To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:
                    Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
                    To this submission. Yet I well remember
                    The favours of these men: were they not mine?
                    Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?

                    With mine own hands I give away my crown,
                    With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
                    With mine own breath release all duty's rites:

                    That, by confessing them, the souls of men

                    If thy offences were upon record,
                    Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
                    To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,
                    There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
                    Containing the deposing of a king
                    And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
                    Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:
                    Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
                    Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,
                    Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
                    Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates
                    Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,

                    Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
                    I find myself a traitor with the rest;
                    For I have given here my soul's consent
                    To undeck the pompous body of a king;
                    Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,

                    No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
                    So many blows upon this face of mine,
                    And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,
                    Like to my followers in prosperity,
                    Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face
                    That every day under his household roof
                    Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face
                    That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
                    Was this the face that faced so many follies,
                    And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?
                    A brittle glory shineth in this face:
                    As brittle as the glory is the face;</text>

                    Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,
                    How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.</text>
                <text char="HENRY BOLINGBROKE" type="verse">The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd

                    The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
                    'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
                    And these external manners of laments
                    Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
                    That swells with silence in the tortured soul;
                    There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,
                    For thy great bounty, that not only givest
                    Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
                    How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,
                    And then be gone and trouble you no more.
                    Shall I obtain it?</text>

                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:
                    For when I was a king, my flatterers

                    I have a king here to my flatterer.

                    Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;
                    One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;

                    Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.</text>
                <text char="DUKE OF YORK" type="verse">Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
                    Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
                    Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
                    With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
                    Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,
                    Bolingbroke!'
                    You would have thought the very windows spake,
                    So many greedy looks of young and old
                    Through casements darted their desiring eyes
                    Upon his visage, and that all the walls
                    With painted imagery had said at once
                    'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
                    Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
                    Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
                    Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'
                    And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.</text>
                <text char="DUCHESS OF YORK" type="verse">Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?</text>
                <text char="DUKE OF YORK" type="verse">As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
                    After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
                    Are idly bent on him that enters next,
                    Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
                    Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
                    Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'
                    No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
                    But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
                    Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
                    His face still combating with tears and smiles,
                    The badges of his grief and patience,
                    That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
                    The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted
                    And barbarism itself have pitied him.
                    But heaven hath a hand in these events,
                    To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
                    To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
                    Whose state and honour I for aye allow.</text>

                    He prays but faintly and would be denied;
                    We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
                    His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;

                    Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
                    Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have

                    Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'
                    And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
                    'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
                    I never long'd to hear a word till now;
                    Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
                    The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
                    No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.</text>

                    Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
                    That set'st the word itself against the word!
                    Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
                    The chopping French we do not understand.
                    Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
                    Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
                    That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,
                    Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.</text>

                <text char="KING RICHARD II" type="verse">I have been studying how I may compare
                    This prison where I live unto the world:
                    And for because the world is populous
                    And here is not a creature but myself,
                    I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.
                    My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
                    My soul the father; and these two beget
                    A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
                    And these same thoughts people this little world,
                    In humours like the people of this world,
                    For no thought is contented. The better sort,
                    As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
                    With scruples and do set the word itself
                    Against the word:
                    As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,
                    'It is as hard to come as for a camel
                    To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
                    Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
                    Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
                    May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
                    Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
                    And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
                    Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
                    That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
                    Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
                    Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
                    That many have and others must sit there;
                    And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
                    Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
                    Of such as have before endured the like.
                    Thus play I in one person many people,
                    And none contented: sometimes am I king;
                    Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
                    And so I am: then crushing penury
                    Persuades me I was better when a king;
                    Then am I king'd again: and by and by
                    Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
                    And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,
                    Nor I nor any man that but man is
                    With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
                    With being nothing. Music do I hear?</text>

                    When time is broke and no proportion kept!
                    So is it in the music of men's lives.
                    And here have I the daintiness of ear
                    To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;
                    But for the concord of my state and time
                    Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
                    I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
                    For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
                    My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
                    Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
                    Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
                    Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
                    Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
                    Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
                    Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
                    Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time
                    Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
                    While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
                    This music mads me; let it sound no more;
                    For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
                    In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
                    Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
                    For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
                    Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</text>

                    O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
                    In London streets, that coronation-day,
                    When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,

                    Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,
                    Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
                    Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
                    Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
                    Since thou, created to be awed by man,
                    Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
                    And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,

                    Upon my head and all this famous land.</text>
                <text char="EXTON" type="verse">From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.</text>
                <text char="HENRY BOLINGBROKE" type="verse">They love not poison that do poison need,
                    Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
                    I hate the murderer, love him murdered.
                    The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,
                    But neither my good word nor princely favour:
                    With Cain go wander through shades of night,
                    And never show thy head by day nor light.
                    Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,
                    That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:
                    Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,
                    And put on sullen black incontinent:
                    I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
                    To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:
                    March sadly after; grace my mournings here;
                    In weeping after this untimely bier.</text>
