                <text char="Flavius" type="verse">Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:
                    Is this a holiday? what! know you not,
                    Being mechanical, you ought not walk
                    Upon a labouring day without the sign
                    Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?</text>
                <text char="First Commoner" type="verse">Why, sir, a carpenter.</text>
                <text char="Marullus" type="verse">Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
                    What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
                    You, sir, what trade are you?</text>
                <text char="Second Commoner" type="verse">Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
                    as you would say, a cobbler.</text>
                <text char="Marullus" type="verse">But what trade art thou? answer me directly.</text>
                <text char="Second Commoner" type="verse">A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
                    conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.</text>
                <text char="Marullus" type="verse">What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?</text>
                <text char="Second Commoner" type="verse">Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
                    if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</text>
                <text char="Marullus" type="verse">What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!</text>
                <text char="Second Commoner" type="verse">Why, sir, cobble you.</text>
                <text char="Flavius" type="verse">Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</text>
                <text char="Second Commoner" type="verse">Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I
                    meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's
                    matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
                    to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I
                    recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
                    neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.</text>
                <text char="Flavius" type="verse">But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
                    Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?</text>
                <text char="Second Commoner" type="verse">Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself
                    into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,
                    to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.</text>
                <text char="Marullus" type="verse">Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
                    What tributaries follow him to Rome,
                    To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
                    You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
                    O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
                    Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
                    Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
                    To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
                    Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
                    The livelong day, with patient expectation,
                    To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
                    And when you saw his chariot but appear,
                    Have you not made an universal shout,
                    That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
                    To hear the replication of your sounds
                    Made in her concave shores?
                    And do you now put on your best attire?
                    And do you now cull out a holiday?
                    And do you now strew flowers in his way
                    That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
                    Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
                    Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
                    That needs must light on this ingratitude.</text>
                <text char="Flavius" type="verse">Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
                    Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
                    Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
                    Into the channel, till the lowest stream
                    Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</text>
                <text type="exeunt">all the Commoners</text>
                <text char="Flavius" type="verse">See whether their basest metal be not moved;
                    They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
                    Go you down that way towards the Capitol;</text>
                <text char="This way will I" type="verse">disrobe the images,
                    If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.</text>
                <text char="Marullus" type="verse">May we do so?
                    You know it is the feast of Lupercal.</text>
                <text char="Flavius" type="verse">It is no matter; let no images
                    Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,
                    And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
                    So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
                    These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
                    Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
                    Who else would soar above the view of men
                    And keep us all in servile fearfulness.</text>

                    Shake off their sterile curse.</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">I shall remember:
                    When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.</text>

                    I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
                    Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.</text>
                <text char="Soothsayer" type="verse">Beware the ides of March.</text>
                <text char="Caesar" type="verse">What man is that?</text>

                <text char="Caesar" type="verse">Set him before me; let me see his face.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.</text>

                <text char="Soothsayer" type="verse">Beware the ides of March.</text>
                <text char="Caesar" type="verse">He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.</text>
                <text type="exeunt">Sennet. all except Brutus and Cassius</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Will you go see the order of the course?</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Not I.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">I pray you, do.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
                    Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
                    Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
                    I'll leave you.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
                    I have not from your eyes that gentleness
                    And show of love as I was wont to have:
                    You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
                    Over your friend that loves you.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Cassius,
                    Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
                    I turn the trouble of my countenance
                    Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
                    Of late with passions of some difference,
                    Conceptions only proper to myself,
                    Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
                    But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
                    Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
                    Nor construe any further my neglect,
                    Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
                    Forgets the shows of love to other men.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
                    By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
                    Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
                    Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
                    But by reflection, by some other things.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">'Tis just:
                    And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
                    That you have no such mirrors as will turn
                    Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
                    That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
                    Where many of the best respect in Rome,
                    Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
                    And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
                    Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
                    That you would have me seek into myself
                    For that which is not in me?</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
                    And since you know you cannot see yourself
                    So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
                    Will modestly discover to yourself
                    That of yourself which you yet know not of.
                    And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
                    Were I a common laugher, or did use
                    To stale with ordinary oaths my love
                    To every new protester; if you know
                    That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
                    And after scandal them, or if you know
                    That I profess myself in banqueting
                    To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</text>
                <text type="stage">Flourish, and shout</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
                    Choose Caesar for their king.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Ay, do you fear it?
                    Then must I think you would not have it so.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
                    But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
                    What is it that you would impart to me?
                    If it be aught toward the general good,
                    Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
                    And I will look on both indifferently,
                    For let the gods so speed me as I love
                    The name of honour more than I fear death.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
                    As well as I do know your outward favour.
                    Well, honour is the subject of my story.
                    I cannot tell what you and other men
                    Think of this life; but, for my single self,
                    I had as lief not be as live to be
                    In awe of such a thing as I myself.
                    I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
                    We both have fed as well, and we can both
                    Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
                    For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
                    The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
                    Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
                    Leap in with me into this angry flood,
                    And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
                    Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
                    And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
                    The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
                    With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
                    And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
                    But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
                    Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
                    I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
                    Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
                    The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
                    Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
                    Is now become a god, and Cassius is
                    A wretched creature and must bend his body,
                    If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
                    He had a fever when he was in Spain,
                    And when the fit was on him, I did mark
                    How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
                    His coward lips did from their colour fly,
                    And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
                    Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
                    Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
                    Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
                    Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
                    As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
                    A man of such a feeble temper should
                    So get the start of the majestic world
                    And bear the palm alone.</text>
                <text type="stage">Shout. Flourish</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Another general shout!
                    I do believe that these applauses are
                    For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
                    Like a Colossus, and we petty men
                    Walk under his huge legs and peep about
                    To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
                    Men at some time are masters of their fates:
                    The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
                    But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
                    Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
                    Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
                    Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
                    Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
                    Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
                    Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
                    Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
                    Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
                    That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
                    Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
                    When went there by an age, since the great flood,
                    But it was famed with more than with one man?
                    When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
                    That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
                    Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
                    When there is in it but one only man.
                    O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
                    There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
                    The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
                    As easily as a king.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
                    What you would work me to, I have some aim:
                    How I have thought of this and of these times,
                    I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
                    I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
                    Be any further moved. What you have said
                    I will consider; what you have to say
                    I will with patience hear, and find a time
                    Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
                    Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
                    Brutus had rather be a villager
                    Than to repute himself a son of Rome
                    Under these hard conditions as this time
                    Is like to lay upon us.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">I am glad that my weak words
                    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">The games are done and Caesar is returning.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
                    And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
                    What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.</text>
                <text type="stage">Re-enter Caesar and his Train</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
                    The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
                    And all the rest look like a chidden train:
                    Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
                    Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
                    As we have seen him in the Capitol,
                    Being cross'd in conference by some senators.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Casca will tell us what the matter is.</text>
                <text char="Caesar" type="verse">Antonius!</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">Caesar?</text>
                <text char="Caesar" type="verse">Let me have men about me that are fat;
                    Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
                    Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
                    He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
                    He is a noble Roman and well given.</text>
                <text char="Caesar" type="verse">Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
                    Yet if my name were liable to fear,
                    I do not know the man I should avoid
                    So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
                    He is a great observer and he looks
                    Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
                    As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
                    Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
                    As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
                    That could be moved to smile at any thing.
                    Such men as he be never at heart's ease
                    Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
                    And therefore are they very dangerous.
                    I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
                    Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
                    Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
                    And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.</text>
                <text type="exeunt">Sennet. Caesar and all his Train, but Casca</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
                    That Caesar looks so sad.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Why, you were with him, were you not?</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
                    offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
                    thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">What was the second noise for?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Why, for that too.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Why, for that too.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Was the crown offered him thrice?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
                    time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
                    mine honest neighbours shouted.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Who offered him the crown?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Why, Antony.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
                    it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
                    Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
                    neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
                    you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
                    thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
                    offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
                    but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
                    fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
                    time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
                    refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
                    chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
                    and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
                    Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
                    Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
                    for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
                    opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
                    mouth, and was speechless.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
                    And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
                    Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
                    clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
                    displeased them, as they use to do the players in
                    the theatre, I am no true man.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">What said he when he came unto himself?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
                    common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
                    plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
                    throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
                    occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
                    I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
                    he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
                    If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
                    their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
                    or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
                    soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
                    there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
                    stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Ay.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Did Cicero say any thing?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Ay, he spoke Greek.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">To what effect?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
                    face again: but those that understood him smiled at
                    one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
                    part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
                    news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
                    off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
                    well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
                    remember it.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">No, I am promised forth.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Will you dine with me to-morrow?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
                    worth the eating.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Good: I will expect you.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Do so. Farewell, both.</text>
                <text type="exit"></text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
                    He was quick mettle when he went to school.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">So is he now in execution
                    Of any bold or noble enterprise,
                    However he puts on this tardy form.
                    This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
                    Which gives men stomach to digest his words
                    With better appetite.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
                    To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
                    I will come home to you; or, if you will,
                    Come home to me, and I will wait for you.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">I will do so: till then, think of the world.</text>

                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
                    Thy honourable metal may be wrought
                    From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
                    That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
                    For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
                    Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
                    If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
                    He should not humour me. I will this night,
                    In several hands, in at his windows throw,
                    As if they came from several citizens,
                    Writings all tending to the great opinion
                    That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
                    Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
                    And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
                    For we will shake him, or worse days endure.</text>

                <text char="Cicero" type="verse">Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
                    Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
                    Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
                    I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
                    Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
                    The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
                    To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
                    But never till to-night, never till now,
                    Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
                    Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
                    Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
                    Incenses them to send destruction.</text>
                <text char="Cicero" type="verse">Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">A common slave--you know him well by sight--
                    Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
                    Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,
                    Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
                    Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
                    Against the Capitol I met a lion,
                    Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
                    Without annoying me: and there were drawn
                    Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
                    Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
                    Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
                    And yesterday the bird of night did sit
                    Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
                    Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
                    Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
                    'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
                    For, I believe, they are portentous things
                    Unto the climate that they point upon.</text>
                <text char="Cicero" type="verse">Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
                    But men may construe things after their fashion,
                    Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
                    Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">He doth; for he did bid Antonius
                    Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.</text>
                <text char="Cicero" type="verse">Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky

                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">A very pleasing night to honest men.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
                    For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
                    Submitting me unto the perilous night,
                    And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
                    Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
                    And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
                    The breast of heaven, I did present myself
                    Even in the aim and very flash of it.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
                    It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
                    When the most mighty gods by tokens send
                    Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
                    That should be in a Roman you do want,
                    Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
                    And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
                    To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
                    But if you would consider the true cause
                    Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
                    Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
                    Why old men fool and children calculate,
                    Why all these things change from their ordinance
                    Their natures and preformed faculties
                    To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
                    That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
                    To make them instruments of fear and warning
                    Unto some monstrous state.
                    Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
                    Most like this dreadful night,
                    That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
                    As doth the lion in the Capitol,
                    A man no mightier than thyself or me
                    In personal action, yet prodigious grown
                    And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Let it be who it is: for Romans now
                    Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
                    But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
                    And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
                    Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
                    Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
                    And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
                    In every place, save here in Italy.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">I know where I will wear this dagger then;
                    Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
                    Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
                    Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
                    Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
                    Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
                    Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
                    But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
                    Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
                    If I know this, know all the world besides,
                    That part of tyranny that I do bear
                    I can shake off at pleasure.</text>
                <text type="stage">Thunder still</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">So can I:
                    So every bondman in his own hand bears
                    The power to cancel his captivity.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
                    Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
                    But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
                    He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
                    Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
                    Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
                    What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
                    For the base matter to illuminate
                    So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
                    Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
                    Before a willing bondman; then I know
                    My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
                    And dangers are to me indifferent.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">You speak to Casca, and to such a man
                    That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
                    Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
                    And I will set this foot of mine as far
                    As who goes farthest.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">There's a bargain made.
                    Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
                    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
                    To undergo with me an enterprise
                    Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
                    And I do know, by this, they stay for me
                    In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
                    There is no stir or walking in the streets;
                    And the complexion of the element
                    In favour's like the work we have in hand,
                    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;

                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
                    And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
                    Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
                    In at his window; set this up with wax
                    Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
                    Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
                    Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?</text>

                    Is ours already, and the man entire
                    Upon the next encounter yields him ours.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
                    And that which would appear offence in us,
                    His countenance, like richest alchemy,
                    Will change to virtue and to worthiness.</text>

                    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
                    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
                    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
                    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
                    And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
                    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
                    That at his will he may do danger with.
                    The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
                    Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
                    I have not known when his affections sway'd
                    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
                    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
                    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
                    But when he once attains the upmost round.
                    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
                    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
                    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
                    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
                    Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
                    Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
                    Would run to these and these extremities:
                    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
                    Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
                    And kill him in the shell.</text>

                    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:

                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">And let us swear our resolution.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
                    The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
                    If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
                    And every man hence to his idle bed;
                    So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
                    Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
                    As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
                    To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
                    The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
                    What need we any spur but our own cause,
                    To prick us to redress? what other bond
                    Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
                    And will not palter? and what other oath
                    Than honesty to honesty engaged,
                    That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
                    Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
                    Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
                    That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
                    Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
                    The even virtue of our enterprise,
                    Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
                    To think that or our cause or our performance
                    Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
                    That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
                    Is guilty of a several bastardy,
                    If he do break the smallest particle
                    Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
                    I think he will stand very strong with us.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Let us not leave him out.</text>
                <text char="Cinna" type="verse">No, by no means.</text>
                <text char="METELLUS CIMBER" type="verse">O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
                    Will purchase us a good opinion
                    And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
                    It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
                    Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
                    But all be buried in his gravity.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">O, name him not: let us not break with him;
                    For he will never follow any thing
                    That other men begin.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Then leave him out.</text>
                <text char="Casca" type="verse">Indeed he is not fit.</text>
                <text char="Decius Brutus" type="verse">Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
                    Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
                    Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
                    A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
                    If he improve them, may well stretch so far
                    As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
                    Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
                    To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
                    Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
                    For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
                    Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
                    We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
                    And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
                    O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
                    And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
                    Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
                    Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
                    Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
                    Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
                    And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
                    Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
                    And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
                    Our purpose necessary and not envious:
                    Which so appearing to the common eyes,
                    We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
                    And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
                    For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
                    When Caesar's head is off.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Yet I fear him;
                    For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
                    If he love Caesar, all that he can do
                    Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:
                    And that were much he should; for he is given
                    To sports, to wildness and much company.</text>
                <text char="TREBONIUS" type="verse">There is no fear in him; let him not die;
                    For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.</text>
                <text type="stage">Clock strikes</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Peace! count the clock.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">The clock hath stricken three.</text>
                <text char="TREBONIUS" type="verse">'Tis time to part.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">But it is doubtful yet,
                    Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;
                    For he is superstitious grown of late,
                    Quite from the main opinion he held once
                    Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
                    It may be, these apparent prodigies,
                    The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
                    And the persuasion of his augurers,
                    May hold him from the Capitol to-day.</text>
                <text char="Decius Brutus" type="verse">Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
                    I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
                    That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
                    And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
                    Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
                    But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
                    He says he does, being then most flattered.
                    Let me work;
                    For I can give his humour the true bent,
                    And I will bring him to the Capitol.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?</text>
                <text char="Cinna" type="verse">Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.</text>
                <text char="METELLUS CIMBER" type="verse">Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
                    Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
                    I wonder none of you have thought of him.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
                    He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
                    Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
                    And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
                    What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
                    Let not our looks put on our purposes,
                    But bear it as our Roman actors do,
                    With untired spirits and formal constancy:
                    And so good morrow to you every one.</text>
                <text type="exeunt">all but Brutus</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
                    Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
                    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
                    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
                    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.</text>
                <text type="enter">Portia</text>
                <text char="Portia" type="verse">Brutus, my lord!</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
                    It is not for your health thus to commit
                    Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.</text>
                <text char="Portia" type="verse">Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
                    Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
                    You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
                    Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
                    And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
                    You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
                    I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
                    And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
                    Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
                    But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
                    Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
                    Fearing to strengthen that impatience
                    Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
                    Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
                    Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
                    It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
                    And could it work so much upon your shape
                    As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
                    I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
                    Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">I am not well in health, and that is all.</text>
                <text char="Portia" type="verse">Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
                    He would embrace the means to come by it.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.</text>
                <text char="Portia" type="verse">Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
                    To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
                    Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
                    And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
                    To dare the vile contagion of the night
                    And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
                    To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
                    You have some sick offence within your mind,
                    Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
                    I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
                    I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
                    By all your vows of love and that great vow
                    Which did incorporate and make us one,
                    That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
                    Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
                    Have had to resort to you: for here have been
                    Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
                    Even from darkness.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Kneel not, gentle Portia.</text>
                <text char="Portia" type="verse">I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
                    Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
                    Is it excepted I should know no secrets
                    That appertain to you? Am I yourself
                    But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
                    To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
                    And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
                    Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
                    Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">You are my true and honourable wife,
                    As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
                    That visit my sad heart</text>
                <text char="Portia" type="verse">If this were true, then should I know this secret.
                    I grant I am a woman; but withal
                    A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
                    I grant I am a woman; but withal
                    A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
                    Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
                    Being so father'd and so husbanded?
                    Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
                    I have made strong proof of my constancy,
                    Giving myself a voluntary wound
                    Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.
                    And not my husband's secrets?</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">O ye gods,
                    Render me worthy of this noble wife!</text>

                    And by and by thy bosom shall partake
                    The secrets of my heart.
                    All my engagements I will construe to thee,
                    All the charactery of my sad brows:

                    To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!</text>
                <text char="LIGARIUS" type="verse">I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
                    Any exploit worthy the name of honour.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
                    Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.</text>
                <text char="LIGARIUS" type="verse">By all the gods that Romans bow before,
                    I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
                    Brave son, derived from honourable loins!
                    Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
                    My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
                    And I will strive with things impossible;
                    Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">A piece of work that will make sick men whole.</text>
                <text char="LIGARIUS" type="verse">But are not some whole that we must make sick?</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
                    I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
                    To whom it must be done.</text>
                <text char="LIGARIUS" type="verse">Set on your foot,
                    And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
                    To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
                    That Brutus leads me on.</text>

                    Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
                    Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
                    A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
                    And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;
                    Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
                    In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
                    Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
                    The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
                    Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
                    And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
                    O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
                    And I do fear them.</text>

                    It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
                    Seeing that death, a necessary end,
                    Will come when it will come.</text>

                    No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well

                    That is enough to satisfy the senate.
                    But for your private satisfaction,
                    Because I love you, I will let you know:
                    Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
                    She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
                    Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
                    Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
                    Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
                    And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
                    And evils imminent; and on her knee
                    Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.</text>
                <text char="Decius Brutus" type="verse">This dream is all amiss interpreted;
                    It was a vision fair and fortunate:
                    Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
                    In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
                    Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
                    Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
                    For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
                    This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.</text>
                <text char="Caesar" type="verse">And this way have you well expounded it.</text>
                <text char="Decius Brutus" type="verse">I have, when you have heard what I can say:
                    And know it now: the senate have concluded
                    To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
                    If you shall send them word you will not come,
                    Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
                    Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
                    'Break up the senate till another time,
                    When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
                    If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
                    'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?
                    Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
                    To our proceeding bids me tell you this;
                    And reason to my love is liable.</text>

                    For I will slay myself.</text>

                    These couchings and these lowly courtesies
                    Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
                    And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
                    Into the law of children. Be not fond,
                    To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
                    That will be thaw'd from the true quality
                    With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
                    Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.
                    Thy brother by decree is banished:
                    If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
                    I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
                    Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause

                <text char="Servant" type="verse">Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:
                    Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
                    And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
                    Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
                    Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:
                    Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;
                    Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.
                    If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
                    May safely come to him, and be resolved
                    How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
                    Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
                    So well as Brutus living; but will follow
                    The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
                    Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
                    With all true faith. So says my master Antony.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
                    I never thought him worse.
                    Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
                    He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,

                    That fears him much; and my misgiving still

                <text char="Antony" type="verse">O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
                    Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
                    Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
                    I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
                    Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
                    If I myself, there is no hour so fit
                    As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument
                    Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
                    With the most noble blood of all this world.
                    I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
                    Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
                    Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
                    I shall not find myself so apt to die:
                    No place will please me so, no mean of death,
                    As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
                    The choice and master spirits of this age.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">O Antony, beg not your death of us.
                    Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
                    As, by our hands and this our present act,
                    You see we do, yet see you but our hands
                    And this the bleeding business they have done:
                    Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
                    And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
                    As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--
                    Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
                    To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:
                    Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
                    Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
                    With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
                    In the disposing of new dignities.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Only be patient till we have appeased
                    The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
                    And then we will deliver you the cause,
                    Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
                    Have thus proceeded.</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">I doubt not of your wisdom.
                    Let each man render me his bloody hand:
                    First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
                    Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
                    Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;
                    Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
                    Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.
                    Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
                    My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
                    That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
                    Either a coward or a flatterer.
                    That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:
                    If then thy spirit look upon us now,
                    Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
                    To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,
                    Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
                    Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
                    Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
                    Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
                    It would become me better than to close
                    In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
                    Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;
                    Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
                    Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.
                    O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;
                    And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
                    How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
                    Dost thou here lie!</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Mark Antony,--</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
                    The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
                    Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
                    But what compact mean you to have with us?
                    Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;
                    Or shall we on, and not depend on you?</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
                    Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
                    Friends am I with you all and love you all,
                    Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
                    Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Or else were this a savage spectacle:
                    Our reasons are so full of good regard
                    That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
                    You should be satisfied.</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">That's all I seek:
                    And am moreover suitor that I may
                    Produce his body to the market-place;
                    And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
                    Speak in the order of his funeral.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">You shall, Mark Antony.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Brutus, a word with you.</text>

                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">You know not what you do: do not consent
                    That Antony speak in his funeral:
                    Know you how much the people may be moved
                    By that which he will utter?</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">By your pardon;
                    I will myself into the pulpit first,
                    And show the reason of our Caesar's death:
                    What Antony shall speak, I will protest
                    He speaks by leave and by permission,
                    And that we are contented Caesar shall
                    Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
                    It shall advantage more than do us wrong.</text>

                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
                    You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
                    But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
                    And say you do't by our permission;
                    Else shall you not have any hand at all
                    About his funeral: and you shall speak
                    In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
                    After my speech is ended.</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">Be it so.
                    I do desire no more.</text>

                    That ever lived in the tide of times.
                    Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
                    Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
                    Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
                    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
                    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
                    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
                    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
                    Blood and destruction shall be so in use
                    And dreadful objects so familiar
                    That mothers shall but smile when they behold
                    Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
                    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
                    And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
                    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
                    Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
                    Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
                    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
                    With carrion men, groaning for burial.</text>

                    If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
                    Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
                    was no less than his. If then that friend demand
                    why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
                    --Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
                    Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
                    die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
                    all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
                    as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
                    valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
                    slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
                    fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
                    ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
                    bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
                    Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
                    any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
                    vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
                    for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.</text>
                <text char="All" type="verse">None, Brutus, none.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
                    Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
                    his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
                    extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences

                <text char="Citizens" type="verse">Peace, ho! let us hear him.</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
                    I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
                    The evil that men do lives after them;
                    The good is oft interred with their bones;
                    So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
                    Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
                    If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
                    And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
                    Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
                    For Brutus is an honourable man;
                    So are they all, all honourable men--
                    Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
                    He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
                    But Brutus says he was ambitious;
                    And Brutus is an honourable man.
                    He hath brought many captives home to Rome
                    Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
                    Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
                    When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
                    Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
                    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
                    And Brutus is an honourable man.
                    You all did see that on the Lupercal
                    I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
                    Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
                    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
                    And, sure, he is an honourable man.
                    I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
                    But here I am to speak what I do know.
                    You all did love him once, not without cause:
                    What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
                    O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
                    And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
                    My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
                    And I must pause till it come back to me.</text>
                <text char="First Citizen" type="verse">Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</text>
                <text char="Second Citizen" type="verse">If thou consider rightly of the matter,
                    Caesar has had great wrong.</text>
                <text char="Third Citizen" type="verse">Has he, masters?
                    I fear there will a worse come in his place.</text>
                <text char="Fourth Citizen" type="verse">Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
                    Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.</text>
                <text char="First Citizen" type="verse">If it be found so, some will dear abide it.</text>
                <text char="Second Citizen" type="verse">Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.</text>
                <text char="Third Citizen" type="verse">There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.</text>
                <text char="Fourth Citizen" type="verse">Now mark him, he begins again to speak.</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">But yesterday the word of Caesar might
                    Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
                    And none so poor to do him reverence.
                    O masters, if I were disposed to stir
                    Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
                    I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
                    Who, you all know, are honourable men:
                    I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
                    To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
                    Than I will wrong such honourable men.
                    But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
                    I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
                    Let but the commons hear this testament--
                    Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
                    And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
                    And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
                    Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
                    And, dying, mention it within their wills,
                    Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
                    Unto their issue.</text>
                <text char="Fourth Citizen" type="verse">We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.</text>
                <text char="All" type="verse">The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
                    It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
                    You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
                    And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
                    It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
                    'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
                    For, if you should, O, what would come of it!</text>
                <text char="Fourth Citizen" type="verse">Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;
                    You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
                    I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
                    I fear I wrong the honourable men
                    Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.</text>
                <text char="Fourth Citizen" type="verse">They were traitors: honourable men!</text>
                <text char="All" type="verse">The will! the testament!</text>
                <text char="Second Citizen" type="verse">They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">You will compel me, then, to read the will?
                    Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
                    And let me show you him that made the will.
                    Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?</text>
                <text char="Several Citizens" type="verse">Come down.</text>
                <text char="Second Citizen" type="verse">Descend.</text>

                    You all do know this mantle: I remember
                    The first time ever Caesar put it on;
                    'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
                    That day he overcame the Nervii:
                    Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
                    See what a rent the envious Casca made:
                    Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
                    And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
                    Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
                    As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
                    If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
                    For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
                    Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
                    This was the most unkindest cut of all;
                    For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
                    Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
                    Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
                    And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
                    Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
                    Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
                    O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
                    Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
                    Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
                    O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
                    The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
                    Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
                    Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
                    Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.</text>

                    To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
                    They that have done this deed are honourable:
                    What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
                    That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
                    And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
                    I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
                    I am no orator, as Brutus is;
                    But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
                    That love my friend; and that they know full well
                    That gave me public leave to speak of him:
                    For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
                    Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
                    To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
                    I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
                    Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
                    And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
                    And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
                    Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
                    In every wound of Caesar that should move
                    The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.</text>

                    His private arbours and new-planted orchards,

                    And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
                    To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.

                    There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
                    For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
                    That they pass by me as the idle wind,
                    Which I respect not. I did send to you
                    For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:
                    For I can raise no money by vile means:
                    By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
                    And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
                    From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
                    By any indirection: I did send
                    To you for gold to pay my legions,
                    Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
                    Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
                    When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
                    To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
                    Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
                    Dash him to pieces!</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">I denied you not.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">You did.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">I did not: he was but a fool that brought
                    My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
                    A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
                    But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">I do not, till you practise them on me.</text>

                    Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
                    For Cassius is aweary of the world;
                    Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
                    Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
                    Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
                    To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
                    My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
                    And here my naked breast; within, a heart
                    Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
                    If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
                    I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
                    Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,
                    When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
                    Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Sheathe your dagger:
                    Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
                    Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.
                    O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
                    That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
                    Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
                    And straight is cold again.</text>

                    To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,

                    Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">No, Messala.</text>
                <text char="Messala" type="verse">Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Nothing, Messala.</text>
                <text char="Messala" type="verse">That, methinks, is strange.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?</text>
                <text char="Messala" type="verse">No, my lord.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.</text>
                <text char="Messala" type="verse">Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
                    For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
                    With meditating that she must die once,
                    I have the patience to endure it now.</text>
                <text char="Messala" type="verse">Even so great men great losses should endure.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">I have as much of this in art as you,
                    But yet my nature could not bear it so.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Well, to our work alive. What do you think
                    Of marching to Philippi presently?</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">I do not think it good.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Your reason?</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">This it is:
                    'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
                    So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
                    Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
                    Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
                    The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
                    Do stand but in a forced affection;
                    For they have grudged us contribution:
                    The enemy, marching along by them,
                    By them shall make a fuller number up,
                    Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
                    From which advantage shall we cut him off,
                    If at Philippi we do face him there,
                    These people at our back.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Hear me, good brother.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Under your pardon. You must note beside,
                    That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
                    Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
                    The enemy increaseth every day;
                    We, at the height, are ready to decline.
                    There is a tide in the affairs of men,
                    Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
                    Omitted, all the voyage of their life
                    Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
                    On such a full sea are we now afloat;
                    And we must take the current when it serves,
                    Or lose our ventures.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Then, with your will, go on;
                    We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
                    And nature must obey necessity;
                    Which we will niggard with a little rest.
                    There is no more to say?</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">No more. Good night:
                    Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.</text>

                <text char="Messala" type="verse">[Standing forth] What says my general?</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Messala,
                    This is my birth-day; as this very day
                    Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
                    Be thou my witness that against my will,
                    As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
                    Upon one battle all our liberties.
                    You know that I held Epicurus strong
                    And his opinion: now I change my mind,
                    And partly credit things that do presage.
                    Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
                    Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
                    Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
                    Who to Philippi here consorted us:
                    This morning are they fled away and gone;
                    And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
                    Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
                    As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
                    A canopy most fatal, under which
                    Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.</text>
                <text char="Messala" type="verse">Believe not so.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">I but believe it partly;
                    For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
                    To meet all perils very constantly.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Even so, Lucilius.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Now, most noble Brutus,
                    The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
                    Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
                    But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
                    Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
                    If we do lose this battle, then is this
                    The very last time we shall speak together:
                    What are you then determined to do?</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Even by the rule of that philosophy
                    By which I did blame Cato for the death
                    Which he did give himself, I know not how,
                    But I do find it cowardly and vile,
                    For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
                    The time of life: arming myself with patience
                    To stay the providence of some high powers
                    That govern us below.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">Then, if we lose this battle,
                    You are contented to be led in triumph
                    Thorough the streets of Rome?</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
                    That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
                    He bears too great a mind. But this same day
                    Must end that work the ides of March begun;
                    And whether we shall meet again I know not.
                    Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
                    For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
                    If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
                    If not, why then, this parting was well made.</text>
                <text char="Cassius" type="verse">For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
                    If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
                    If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
                    The end of this day's business ere it come!
                    But it sufficeth that the day will end,
                    And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!</text>

                    A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;
                    Give him all kindness: I had rather have
                    Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
                    And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;
                    And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
                    How every thing is chanced.</text>

                    He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;
                    It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.</text>

                <text char="Dardanius" type="verse">To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.</text>
                <text char="Clitus" type="verse">Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
                    That it runs over even at his eyes.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.</text>
                <text char="Volumnius" type="verse">What says my lord?</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Why, this, Volumnius:
                    The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
                    Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
                    And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
                    I know my hour is come.</text>
                <text char="Volumnius" type="verse">Not so, my lord.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
                    Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
                    Our enemies have beat us to the pit:</text>
                <text type="stage">Low alarums</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
                    Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
                    Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
                    Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
                    Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.</text>
                <text char="Volumnius" type="verse">That's not an office for a friend, my lord.</text>
                <text type="stage">Alarum still</text>
                <text char="Clitus" type="verse">Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
                    Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
                    Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
                    My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
                    I found no man but he was true to me.
                    I shall have glory by this losing day
                    More than Octavius and Mark Antony
                    By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
                    So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
                    Hath almost ended his life's history:
                    Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
                    That have but labour'd to attain this hour.</text>
                <text type="stage">Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!'</text>
                <text char="Clitus" type="verse">Fly, my lord, fly.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Hence! I will follow.</text>
                <text type="exeunt">Clitus, Dardanius, and Volumnius</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
                    Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
                    Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
                    Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
                    While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?</text>
                <text char="Strato" type="verse">Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Farewell, good Strato.</text>
                <text type="stage">Runs on his sword</text>
                <text char="Brutus" type="verse">Caesar, now be still:
                    I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.</text>
                <text type="stage">Dies</text>
                <text type="enter">Alarum. Retreat. Octavius, Antony, Messala, Lucilius, and the army</text>
                <text char="Octavius" type="verse">What man is that?</text>
                <text char="Messala" type="verse">My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?</text>
                <text char="Strato" type="verse">Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
                    The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
                    For Brutus only overcame himself,
                    And no man else hath honour by his death.</text>
                <text char="Lucilius" type="verse">So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
                    That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.</text>
                <text char="Octavius" type="verse">All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
                    Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?</text>
                <text char="Strato" type="verse">Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.</text>
                <text char="Octavius" type="verse">Do so, good Messala.</text>
                <text char="Messala" type="verse">How died my master, Strato?</text>
                <text char="Strato" type="verse">I held the sword, and he did run on it.</text>
                <text char="Messala" type="verse">Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
                    That did the latest service to my master.</text>
                <text char="Antony" type="verse">This was the noblest Roman of them all:
                    All the conspirators save only he
                    Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
                    He only, in a general honest thought
                    And common good to all, made one of them.
                    His life was gentle, and the elements
                    So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
                    And say to all the world 'This was a man!'</text>
                <text char="Octavius" type="verse">According to his virtue let us use him,
                    With all respect and rites of burial.
                    Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,
                    Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.
                    So call the field to rest; and let's away,
                    To part the glories of this happy day.</text>
