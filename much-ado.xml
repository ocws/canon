                <text type="enter">Leonato, Hero, and Beatrice, with a Messenger</text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
                    comes this night to Messina.
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
                    when I left him.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">But few of any sort, and none of name.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
                    home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
                    bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
                    Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
                    promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,
                    the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
                    bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
                    tell you how.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
                    glad of it.
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">I have already delivered him letters, and there
                    appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could
                    not show itself modest enough without a badge of
                    bitterness.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">Did he break out into tears?
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">In great measure.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
                    truer than those that are so washed. How much
                    better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the
                    wars or no?
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">I know none of that name, lady: there was none such
                    in the army of any sort.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">What is he that you ask for, niece?
                </text>
                <text char="Hero" type="verse">My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
                    Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading
                    the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
                    him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
                    killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
                    he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;
                    but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:
                    he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
                    excellent stomach.
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">And a good soldier too, lady.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all
                    honourable virtues.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:
                    but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a
                    kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
                    they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
                    between them.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
                    conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
                    now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
                    he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
                    bear it for a difference between himself and his
                    horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
                    to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
                    companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">Is't possible?
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
                    the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
                    next block.
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray
                    you, who is his companion? Is there no young
                    squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he
                    is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
                    runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
                    he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
                    thousand pound ere a' be cured.
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">I will hold friends with you, lady.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">Do, good friend.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">You will never run mad, niece.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">No, not till a hot January.
                </text>
                <text char="Messenger" type="verse">Don Pedro is approached.
                </text>
                <text type="enter">Don Pedro, Don John, Claudio, Benedick, and BALTHASAR</text>
                <text char="Don Pedro" type="verse">Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your
                    trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
                    cost, and you encounter it.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
                    your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
                    remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides
                    and happiness takes his leave.
                </text>
                <text char="Don Pedro" type="verse">You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
                    is your daughter.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">Her mother hath many times told me so.
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.
                </text>
                <text char="Don Pedro" type="verse">You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this
                    what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers
                    herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an
                    honourable father.
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
                    have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as
                    like him as she is.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior
                    Benedick: nobody marks you.
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
                    such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
                    Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come
                    in her presence.
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
                    am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I
                    would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
                    heart; for, truly, I love none.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">A dear happiness to women: they would else have
                    been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
                    and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I
                    had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
                    swear he loves me.
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
                    gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
                    scratched face.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
                    a face as yours were.
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and
                    so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's
                    name; I have done.
                </text>
                <text char="Beatrice" type="verse">You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.
                </text>
                <text char="Don Pedro" type="verse">That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio
                    and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath
                    invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
                    the least a month; and he heartily prays some
                    occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
                    hypocrite, but prays from his heart.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.
                </text>
                <text type="stage">To Don John</text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to
                    the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
                </text>
                <text char="Don John" type="verse">I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank
                    you.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">Please it your grace lead on?
                </text>
                <text char="Don Pedro" type="verse">Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.
                </text>
                <text type="exeunt">all except Benedick and Claudio</text>
                <text char="Claudio" type="verse">Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">I noted her not; but I looked on her.
                </text>
                <text char="Claudio" type="verse">Is she not a modest young lady?
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for
                    my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak
                    after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
                </text>
                <text char="Claudio" type="verse">No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high
                    praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little
                    for a great praise: only this commendation I can
                    afford her, that were she other than she is, she
                    were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I
                    do not like her.
                </text>
                <text char="Claudio" type="verse">Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
                    truly how thou likest her.
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?
                </text>
                <text char="Claudio" type="verse">Can the world buy such a jewel?
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this
                    with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,
                    to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
                    rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take
                    you, to go in the song?
                </text>
                <text char="Claudio" type="verse">In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
                    looked on.
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
                    matter: there's her cousin, an she were not
                    possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty
                    as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
                    hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
                </text>
                <text char="Claudio" type="verse">I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
                    contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world
                    one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
                    Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
                    Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
                    into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
                    Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.

                    When you went onward on this ended action,
                    I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
                    That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
                    Than to drive liking to the name of love:
                    But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
                    Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
                    Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
                    All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
                    Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.

                <text char="Don Pedro" type="verse">Thou wilt be like a lover presently
                    And tire the hearer with a book of words.
                    If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
                    And I will break with her and with her father,
                    And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end

                    I would have salved it with a longer treatise.

                    And I will fit thee with the remedy.
                    I know we shall have revelling to-night:
                    I will assume thy part in some disguise
                    And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
                    And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
                    And take her hearing prisoner with the force
                    And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
                    Then after to her father will I break;
                    And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.

                    wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,

                    repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the

                    another man is a fool when he dedicates his
                    behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at
                    such shallow follies in others, become the argument
                    of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
                    is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
                    with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he
                    rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
                    when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
                    good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,
                    carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
                    speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
                    and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
                    words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many
                    strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
                    these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
                    be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
                    I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
                    of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
                    is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
                    well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all
                    graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in
                    my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,
                    or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;
                    fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not
                    near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good
                    discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall
                    be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and

                    another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the
                    scene that I would see, which will be merely a

                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">This can be no trick: the
                    conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
                    this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
                    seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
                    why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
                    they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
                    the love come from her; they say too that she will
                    rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
                    never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
                    are they that hear their detractions and can put
                    them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a
                    truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis
                    so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
                    me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
                    no great argument of her folly, for I will be
                    horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
                    odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
                    because I have railed so long against marriage: but
                    doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
                    in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
                    Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
                    the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
                    No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
                    die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
                    were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!
                    she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
                    her.

                    to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains
                    that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do

                    Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula
                    Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
                    Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;

                    When I do name him, let it be thy part

                    My talk to thee must be how Benedick
                    Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
                    Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,

                <text char="Hero" type="verse">They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;

                    To wish him wrestle with affection,
                    And never to let Beatrice know of it.

                <text char="Ursula" type="verse">Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman

                <text char="Hero" type="verse">O god of love! I know he doth deserve
                    As much as may be yielded to a man:
                    But Nature never framed a woman's heart
                    Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
                    Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
                    Misprising what they look on, and her wit
                    Values itself so highly that to her
                    All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
                    Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
                    She is so self-endeared.
                </text>
                <text char="Ursula" type="verse">Sure, I think so;
                    And therefore certainly it were not good
                    She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
                </text>
                <text char="Hero" type="verse">Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
                    How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
                    But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,
                    She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
                    If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
                    Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
                    If low, an agate very vilely cut;
                    If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
                    If silent, why, a block moved with none.
                    So turns she every man the wrong side out
                    And never gives to truth and virtue that
                    Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
                </text>
                <text char="Ursula" type="verse">Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
                </text>
                <text char="Hero" type="verse">No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
                    As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
                    But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
                    She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
                    Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
                    Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
                    Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
                    It were a better death than die with mocks,
                    Which is as bad as die with tickling.
                </text>
                <text char="Ursula" type="verse">Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.
                </text>
                <text char="Hero" type="verse">No; rather I will go to Benedick
                    And counsel him to fight against his passion.
                    And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
                    To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
                    How much an ill word may empoison liking.

                <text char="Ursula" type="verse">O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.
                    She cannot be so much without true judgment--
                    Having so swift and excellent a wit
                    As she is prized to have--as to refuse

                    meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance
                    that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am
                    not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list
                    not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,
                    if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you
                    are in love or that you will be in love or that you
                    can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and
                    now is he become a man: he swore he would never
                    marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats
                    his meat without grudging: and how you may be
                    converted I know not, but methinks you look with
                    your eyes as other women do.

                    For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
                    And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
                    To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
                    And never shall it more be gracious.

                    Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:

                    O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
                    Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
                    Why had I not with charitable hand
                    Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
                    Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,
                    I might have said 'No part of it is mine;
                    This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
                    But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised

                    That I myself was to myself not mine,
                    Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen
                    Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
                    Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
                    And salt too little which may season give

                    A thousand blushing apparitions
                    To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
                    In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;
                    And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
                    To burn the errors that these princes hold
                    Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
                    Trust not my reading nor my observations,
                    Which with experimental seal doth warrant

                    If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here

                <text char="Friar Francis" type="verse">Pause awhile,

                    Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
                    Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
                    And publish it that she is dead indeed;
                    Maintain a mourning ostentation
                    And on your family's old monument
                    Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
                    That appertain unto a burial.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">What shall become of this? what will this do?
                </text>
                <text char="Friar Francis" type="verse">Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
                    Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
                    But not for that dream I on this strange course,
                    But on this travail look for greater birth.
                    She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,
                    Upon the instant that she was accused,
                    Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
                    Of every hearer: for it so falls out
                    That what we have we prize not to the worth
                    Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
                    Why, then we rack the value, then we find
                    The virtue that possession would not show us
                    Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
                    When he shall hear she died upon his words,
                    The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
                    Into his study of imagination,
                    And every lovely organ of her life
                    Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
                    More moving-delicate and full of life,
                    Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
                    Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
                    If ever love had interest in his liver,
                    And wish he had not so accused her,
                    No, though he thought his accusation true.
                    Let this be so, and doubt not but success
                    Will fashion the event in better shape
                    Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
                    But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
                    The supposition of the lady's death
                    Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
                    And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
                    As best befits her wounded reputation,
                    In some reclusive and religious life,
                    Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.

                    But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
                    Bring me a father that so loved his child,

                    No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience
                    To those that wring under the load of sorrow,

                    great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'
                    'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it
                    hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman
                    is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'
                    'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I
                    believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on
                    Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;
                    there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus
                    did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular
                    virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou
                    wast the properest man in Italy.

                    Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,

                    You must be father to your brother's daughter
                    And give her to young Claudio.

                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">To bind me, or undo me; one of them.
                    Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,
                    Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.
                </text>
                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">And I do with an eye of love requite her.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">The sight whereof I think you had from me,
                    From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?

                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:
                    But, for my will, my will is your good will
                    May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd
                    In the state of honourable marriage:
                    In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.
                </text>
                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">My heart is with your liking.

                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:
                    We here attend you. Are you yet determined

                    That you have such a February face,

                <text char="Claudio" type="verse">I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
                    Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold
                    And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
                    As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
                    When he would play the noble beast in love.

                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;
                    And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,
                    And got a calf in that same noble feat
                    Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.
                </text>
                <text char="Claudio" type="verse">For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.

                <text char="Leonato" type="verse">No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
                    Before this friar and swear to marry her.

                <text char="Claudio" type="verse">Give me your hand: before this holy friar,
                    I am your husband, if you like of me.

                <text char="Claudio" type="verse">And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
                    For here's a paper written in his hand,
                    A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
                    Fashion'd to Beatrice.

                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.
                    Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take

                    upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,
                    for I was told you were in a consumption.

                <text char="Benedick" type="verse">I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of
                    wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost
                    thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No:
                    if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear
                    nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do
                    purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any
                    purpose that the world can say against it; and
                    therefore never flout at me for what I have said
                    against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my
                    conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to
                    have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my
                    kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.

                <text char="Claudio" type="verse">I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,
                    that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
                    life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of
                    question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look
                    exceedingly narrowly to thee.
